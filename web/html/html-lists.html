    <h1>HTML Lists</h1>
    <h3>&lt;ul&gt; Unordered list</h3>
    <p>Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of the items doesn't matter. Let's take a shopping list as an example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>item</li>
        <li>item</li>
        <li>item</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Grocery shopping list:</p>

    <pre class="input">
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;Cheese&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li>Bread&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li>Eggs&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>

    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cheese
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>&lt;ol&gt; Ordered list</h3>
    <p>Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. Let's take a set of directions as an example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>item</li>
        <li>item</li>
        <li>item</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Nesting lists</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
        <li>
          Process all the ingredients into a paste.
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
            </li>
            <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>      
  <h3>Description lists:</h3>
  <p>The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.</p>
<p>Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types â€” &lt;dl&gt; (description list) in addition each term is wrapped in a &lt;dt&gt; (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a &lt;dd&gt; (description definition) element.</p>

<pre class="input">
  &lt;dl&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;soliloquy&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;
      In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner
      thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but
      not to other characters.)
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;monologue&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;
      In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
      with the audience and any other characters present.
    &lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dt&gt;aside&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;
      In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
      humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of
      additional background information.
    &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;
